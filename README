Installer for the quantracker APM toolchain

Designed to enable the toolchain to be installed easily on various operating systems.

Currently supported by Linux and Windows

Dependencies.

For Windows, a GNU-Linux like Build Environment is required.
The app currently only builds on Cygwin

For each of these packages , it should be checked that
the following cmd line apps are installed
    g++  >= 4.7
    make
    wget
    unzip
    tar
    mkdir
    mv
    mkdir
    rmdir
    rm

For Native Linux
  Most linux distros should already have all these basic apps installed
  pre-installed as part of the operating system.

Building
  Though it would be possible to provide a binary for Windows, building the installer
  is a useful test of the toolchain.
  Download and unzip the Github zip to a directory and invoke make in that directory.

  After a successful build, the executable airtool.exe will be in the bin/ subdirectory

Running.
   On linux enter the air_installer/bin directory and invoke ./airtool.exe
   If you wish to control the directries, you can use command line argumments (TO document)

   On Windows, it is simpler to run the installer from within its shell:

   In MINGW/MSYS:

   <$ cd /c/path_to_air_installer/bin
   <$  ./airtool.exe optional_args]

   In Cygwin

   <$ cd /cygdrive/path_to_installer/bin
   <$  ./airtool.exe optional_args]

   It is possible to run it fom a Windows Terminal, but the path to the Linux binutils must be set.
   For Cygwin, the Cygwin dll cygwin1.dll must be available. This can be achieved by adding the
   Cygwin/bin/ directory to your path
